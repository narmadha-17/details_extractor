# details_extractor
This Python script uses LinkedIn scraping, image comparison, and the Tavily Search API to extract structured company details from a set of input URLsâ€”or by searching when none are provided.  It intelligently compares a local company logo to logos found on LinkedIn to identify the most accurate URL match before extracting company information.
